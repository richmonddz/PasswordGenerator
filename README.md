# PasswordGenerator

Working on this project was challenging. We had to use java script and apply new techniques to create a functioning password generator that had parameters to choose from and populate onto the page. The password generator showcases the use of variables, arrays, functions and more. I had trouble working with the "for loop" and getting it to populate my password but eventually figured it out. Another issue I came across was having to refresh the page every time I wanted to create a new password. If the page is not refreshed the parameters dont seem to work properly.

To use the password generator you will have to click on the generate password button. After, you will see a prompt for password length and parameters (numbers,lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols). At least one must be chosen and a password length of 8-128 chracters. Once a password is created you can copy paste to where you desire.

**TO CREATE ANOTHER PASSWORD PLEASE REFRESH THE PAGE AND START AGAIN.**

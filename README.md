# PasswordGenerator

### A tool for creating randomized passwords

# Description

Working on this project was challenging. We had to use java script and apply new techniques to create a functioning password generator that had parameters to choose from and populate onto the page. The password generator showcases the use of variables, arrays, functions and more. I had trouble working with the "for loop" and getting it to populate my password but eventually figured it out. Another issue I came across was having to refresh the page every time I wanted to create a new password. If the page is not refreshed the parameters dont seem to work properly.

The Password generator helps create complex random passwords that can have a multitude of different variables.

To use the password generator you will have to click on the generate password button. After, you will see a prompt for password length and parameters (numbers,lowercase letters, uppercase letters, symbols). At least one must be chosen and a password length of 8-128 chracters. Once a password is created you can copy paste to where you desire.

**TO CREATE ANOTHER PASSWORD PLEASE REFRESH THE PAGE AND START AGAIN.**
